Big Data Final Project

Abstract
We live in an age where massive amounts of data is created every day. It is estimated that about 2.5 Quintilian bytes of data is created each day. Data is being generated without any thought. With all this data being created, it was thought that generating thoughts and conclusions from this massive amount data will help in being able to result in faster service, better prediction or even assist you better in your daily life. This gave rise to the study of Big Data. In this report, there will be a clear outline of the work done on NYC Open Data. This large collection of public data helps generate insights that can help the City Government serve the publiv better. By using this data, we can research conclusions and request resources where it is needed, and there is factual evidence that shows that it is required through analysis.

In Task 1, Metadata for NYCOpenData datasets is generated. This can be very helpful as it is possible that all NYCOpenData datasets have an adequate amount of metadata. This metadata includes the counts of cells, the datatypes and statistics related to the dataset.

In Task2, identification of the semantic types for each column in an NYCOpenData dataset was performed. The semantic types include Person name, Address, LAT/LON coordinates, Building Classification, School name, and so on. \newline \newline 
In Task 3, Analysis on 311 data from 2010 to 2019 was done. Questions like "What are the most frequent complaints in Brooklyn?" and "How long on average does it take for a complaint in Manhattan take to get solved?" were solved. 
There was also some visualization done which can be used to show the distribution over time.
